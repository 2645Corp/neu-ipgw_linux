### Quick Start

**To install it to your computer,**

open terminal and run

`$ sudo sh ./install.sh`

After running the installer, you may either start from the "Application Menu", or run by command `ipgw`. <br>
Use `ipgw --help` to get more information of usage. <br>
The program will be installed to `/usr/local/neuipgw/` <br>
You may change the configuration of the installed program by editing `/usr/local/neuipgw/user.cfg`

**If you prefer not to install it,**

Just sh the ipgw.sh, it will also work okay. The configuration will be sourced from the file `user.cfg` under the same directory as the program.
